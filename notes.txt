personal random notes

basic git commands

$ git commit -am "its something"
$ git push origin master
$ git pull origin master


I'm coding a simple responsive static website enjoying lot of css3 new features (as flexbox).
* more minimalist than Bootstrap (as Pure, Skeleton CSS frameworks).
* more brief than popular JS (jquery, angular, ajax).
* processing Jade and Stylus with Prepros.
* editing Sublime Text 3 with Emmet on Windows OS.
* embed [Disqus](https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/) to enable comments.
* with cool modern font like [Ubuntu](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Ubuntu)

Will be not compatible with IE9, assuming that in near future most Windows users will shift to Windows 10 modern browsers (as Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi). 

Actually I'm Civil Engineering Student from Brazil, with half-Japanese and half-Brazilian native ancestry.

I had to learn English because most of my college textbooks are written in English. I read English websites most of time to access worldwide culture on Internet.

I'm learning (forgotten) Japanese to be able to talk with relatives in Japan, trying to <br />**make it easier** **(ᴼДᴼ) → (^ω^)**.<br />I relax in 9gag, [Nicovideo](http://www.nicovideo.jp/ranking) and Youtube. I also like anime & draw as hobby.

I want to learn node.js in near future. I lost motivation to keep learning PHP (of Wordpress, Wikipedia), Rails or Django. Because new technologies as node.js seems better.

<!-- Greece.
I respect Greece as cradle of western civilization.
But earn money only with tourism IS MADNESS (IT’s SPARTA).
If you want be able pay the debts to Germany.
Invest in IT, Industry, and start exporting Technology.
Of course it’s not easy but
Shia Lebouf certanly would say “nothing is impossile, just do it”
It’s my opinion and haters gonna hate.
Well..If you hate my opinion. & wanna kill my relatives,
i suggest start killing my relatives those ask money and dont pays debts.
Just like germans wanna do
(Argentina did default many times, result? Consequences? Argentina becomes more and more broken.)
(as tyrion lannister, i always pay my debt, even broken)
