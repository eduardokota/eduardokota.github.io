[Outsource](http://cloudcannon.com/tips/2014/12/12/the-ultimate-list-of-services-for-static-websites.html) are handy but slowdown when overused, as [Webfonts](https://www.google.com/fonts), [Social Login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login) &amp;
frameworks ([CSS](http://www.cssauthor.com/css-frameworks/), [JS](http://beebom.com/2015/04/best-javascript-frameworks-and-libraries), [Node](http://nodeframework.com/), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)).



[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), 
[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), 
[Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) and
[Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) are pretty code shorthands. [Export to web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) with [Prepros](https://prepros.io/).


Many Code langs have limited use
+ [Java] for [Android], [robots], [crafts], [banking] and [enterprises]. [Swift] or [ObjC] for Apple. [C#] for Microsoft. [Python] for Research and Django. [Ruby] on Rails or Sinatra.
+ [C++] is harder to learn. Interact with hardware for make OS components and Game Engines. Code changes with Platform. [Golang] and [Rust] can be rivals in future.
+ [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a pretty shorthand for the quirky [JS](http://beebom.com/2015/04/best-javascript-frameworks-and-libraries) to make Web apps.
+ [Python](https://www.python.org/) is unpopular in East Asia, because Asian languages [are tricky to type](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14682933/chinese-and-japanese-character-support-in-python), but easier in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) or made in Japan [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

Code editor

+ [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is the fastest. Need [Package Control](http://packagecontrol.io). [Freemium](http://www.freemium.org/what-is-freemium-2/) and proprietary. [Developed slowly](https://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=17340&start=30) by [a single man](http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/). Coded in C++ and Python.
+ [Atom](https://atom.io/) has coolest design, crashes a lot, but getting better. [Developed by active Github volunteers](https://github.com/atom/atom). Coded with [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/),  [NodeJS](http://nodeframework.com/) and [web techs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web).
+ [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) has fancy features. As Live Preview, but [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) is better for it. Developed by [Adobe corporation](http://www.adobe.com/).  Coded in [web techs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web).
+ [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Brackets](https://atom.io/) have [FLOSS licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software#FLOSS_2), and are very easier to use and learn even for a layman, unlike [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/).
+ [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) plugin/package is essential for web-developers in any editor.
+ For type Asian Languages. [IMESuport](https://github.com/chikatoike/IMESupport) Package is needed on [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/). [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is buggy. [Atom](https://atom.io/) work fine.
