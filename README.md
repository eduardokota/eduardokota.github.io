This is just a personal test/draft/sandbox.
I'm just a beginner and just started learning frontend code.

I'm coding a simple responsive static website enjoying lot of css3 new features (as flexbox).
* more minimalist than Bootstrap (as Pure, Skeleton CSS frameworks).
* more brief than popular JS (jquery, angular, ajax).
* processing Jade and Stylus with Prepros.
* editing Sublime Text 3 with Emmet on Windows OS.
* embed [Disqus](https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/) to enable comments.
* with cool modern font like [Ubuntu](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Ubuntu)

Will be not compatible with IE9, assuming that in near future most Windows users will shift to Windows 10 modern browsers (as Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi). 

Actually I'm Civil Engineering Student from Brazil, with half-Japanese and half-Brazilian native ancestry.

I had to learn English because most of my college textbooks are written in English. I read English websites most of time to access worldwide culture on Internet.

I'm learning (forgotten) Japanese to be able to talk with relatives in Japan, trying to <br />**make it easier** **(ᴼДᴼ) → (^ω^)**.<br />I relax in 9gag, [Nicovideo](http://www.nicovideo.jp/ranking) and Youtube. I also like anime & draw as hobby.

I want to learn node.js in near future. I lost motivation to keep learning PHP (of Wordpress, Wikipedia), Rails or Django. Because new technologies as node.js seems better.
