##<sub>hard</sub>(°Д°) → (^ω^)<sub>easier</sub>

This is just a personal test/draft/sandbox.
I'm just a beginner and just start learning frontend code.

I'm testing building a simple responsive static website
* enjoying lot of css3 new features (as flexbox)
* more minimalist than Bootstrap (as Pure, Skeleton CSS frameworks)
* less JS, more brief than popular JS (jquery, angular, ajax)
* using Jade and Stylus

Will be not compatible with IE9, assuming that in near future most windows users will shift to Windows 10 Edge browser

Actually I'm Civil Engineering Student from Brazil, with half-Japanese and half-Brazil native ancestry.

I had to learn English because most of my college textbooks are written in English. I read English websites most of time to access worldwide culture on Internet.

I'm learning (forgotten) Japanese to be able talk with relatives in Japan. trying make the (°Д°)hard→easier(^ω^).
